# Rulings on constructions

I try to keep alphabetical order

## Addressees and clauses

### Description

>τοὔνεκά *οἱ *προθέουσιν ὀνείδεα *μυθήσασθαι (Il. 1.291)

Addressee can be in dat or acc.

### Ruling

As the dat addressee would be an `iobj` under normal circumstances, I rule it as
`obj` here; the addressee almost always controls the subject of the clause, thus
the head of the clause is an `xcomp`.

In the rare cases when it is not controlled, then `ccomp`.

If a dative is not an addressee (e.g. with verbs meaning "to appear", "look like"),
then `obl:arg`.

## Proleptic demonstratives

### Description

>τόδε ἴσθι, ὅτι...

There are a few different constructions that could be distinguished. In some cases,
the clause does not look like a subordinate (no conjunction, no infinitive), and
it could be taken as a normal case of `parataxis`. Compare En.:

>This I will say to you, none of you shall return

It will be normal to have:
```
parataxis(have, return)
```

But in most cases, the clause is a clear subordinate, either with acc/inf or by
some complementizer (particles for indirect questions, conjunctions). Int. ind.
clauses might be dubious, as they can also be taken as direct questions.

### Ruling

At present, I have nothing better to offer than `parataxis` with the pronoun
governing the clause. That's just a stub, but it should be easy to retrieve.

### How to retrieve

Look for `parataxis` of verbs governed by what is in most cases a `PRON`, but
`DET` or even `ADJ` could be possible.
