# Annotation of selected words

## VERBS

### δοκέω

With the personal construction, δοκέω is a sort of "raising" verb:
- the raised subject: `nsubj`
- the inf. clause: `xcomp`

The same is also true for "semi-impersonal" construction such as
>ὥς μοι δοκεῖ εἶναι ἄριστα (Il. 12.205)

When the construction is impersonal, than the clause acts as a subject and is
therefore annotated `csubj`.

The dative person is always `obl:arg`.

### κλύω

The verb has many constructions (see [LSJ](https://logeion.uchicago.edu/%CE%BA%CE%BB%CF%8D%CF%89)).
* gen of person + acc of theme (κέκλυτέ μευ . . μῦθον Ἀλεξάνδροιο Il. 3.86)
* gen only or acc only
* gen of person + gen of theme (κέκλυτέ μευ μύθων, Od. 12.271)
* gen of theme only
* acc + inf
* acc + part

I'd say that the gen personae is always `obl:arg`. The gen rei is more complicated.
I will go on to consider it `obj` for the moment.
