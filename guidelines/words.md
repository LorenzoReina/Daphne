## VERBS

### δοκέω

With the personal construction, δοκέω is a sorto of "raising" verb:
- the raised subject: `nsubj`
- the inf. clause: `xcomp`

The same is also true for "semi-impersonal" construction such as 
>ὥς μοι δοκεῖ εἶναι ἄριστα (Il. 12.205)

When the construction is impersonal, than the clause acts as a subject and is
therefore annotated `csubj`.

The dative person is always `obl:arg`.
