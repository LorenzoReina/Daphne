# Euripides (TLG 0006)

## Source

The treebank of *Medea* was taken from [Pedalion](https://github.com/perseids-publications/pedalion-trees).

*Medea* was originally annotated by Toon Van Hal and students at the KLU (2018-19;
see [here](https://github.com/perseids-publications/pedalion-trees#euripides-medea-complete)
for a complete list).

If you spot any error or missing information, please report everything in the
[issue](https://github.com/francescomambrini/Daphne/issues) section.

## Conversion and revision

Pedalion uses an AGLDT-compliant format, with minor modifications. The files were converted to UD
using the [tb2ud](https://github.com/francescomambrini/tb2ud) set of scripts.

All UD files of Euripides were reviewed by Francesco Mambrini.
