Philoctetes (tlg0011.tlg006)


642: οὐκ, ἀλλά...: is the reading of the MSS. Several editors (LL-J, Avezzù-Pucci, 
Schein) print Doederlein οἶδ'· ἀλλά... The sense is however clear even with the 
transmitted text (Kam: "not so, but on the contrary"); it doesn't seem to me that 
the conjecture improves on it.
